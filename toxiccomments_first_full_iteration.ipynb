Obviously, the authors of this Wiki found a list of Christians who think Jesus is real, and one Atheist (Ehrman). Now it's been compiled into a ridiculous paragraph, as  mentioned, and spread to every Jesus article. Statements from historians like Richard Carrier, or as   your ilk prefer to call him, \"\"blogger\"\" are routinely removed from this article as are statements from Ehrman which are critical of historical Jesus claims regarding what is and isn't accepted as historical. So, just because you've compiled a short paragraph,   with a few pastors and priests who think Jesus was real, doesn't mean I have to find a paragraph that states otherwise. The point is, this article is full of that type of BS, and we don't need to disprove your claims any more than we need to disprove claims of a magic spaghetti monster, so quit with your snivelling rhetoric about personal attacks and us finding reliable sources to disprove your positive claims. The fact is, those sources, as Bash Prompt and 3 or 4 others have already indicated DO NOT BELONG. Capice? Not sure if English is your first language, Wong, but I hope you catch my drift, and if you're all butt hurt about personal attacks take it up with the board instead of whining and bitching like a snivelling child who's just been told that the tooth fairy isn't real.  \"\n",

You are becoming a man who has been chemically and cosmetically altered into a facsimile of femininity; a stereotypical pseudo-woman. You are NOT a real woman; you are a man with a low sex drive and clearly an equally low opinion of real women.

You never paused to wonder whether your male body requires different testosterone levels compared to a woman's in order to achieve the same level of sex drive.
