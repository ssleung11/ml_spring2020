I've said it once and I'll say it again- it's people like you, with little to no creativity and a desk job from 9-5, that get your kicks out on start up wikipedians. Your power is falsified and if ever one day something happens to the infrastructure of the internet, you'd be shit out of luck like a milkman in the 1980's.

I’m already out there concerned about this so I’m really outraged to be stereotyped in that way by her because I am a career teacher and yes, when you have a situation where commercialised sex is being pushed without a true eroticism…I’ve been saying this for years, that we have got to a point of meaningless exhibitionism without real eroticism.

Paglia is somewhat of an intellectual enigma, a conservative and academic feminist, who revels in low and high culture alike and celebrates sexualities disapproved of by mainstream Western culture.
